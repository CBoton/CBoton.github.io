        <h2>Dataset</h2>

        <p>
            For this assignment, our team decided to use the 2017 US Census Dataset located on Kaggle's website. We found that this dataset had a lot of possibilities and questions to be answered.
        </p>

        <p>
            The data is available online at:
            <strong>

        <h2>Interactive Design Decisions</h2>

        <p>
            We first considered creating a map of California where the user could click on each county to view the data, but we decided this would not depict the data very accurately. Our team settled on using an interactive graph of the top ten populous counties in California. The user can select from 23 statistics to be compared by county. We went this route because it provides comparable data between the top ten counties in California, showing the differences and similarities of each county.
        </p>

        <p>
            The interactive d3 starter code we used can be found at:

        <h2>Overview of Development Process</h2>

        <p>
            The time spent on this development was roughly 15 people-hours. Curtis spent a lot of time looking around for
            interactive d3 starter code that our team could build off of. He also wrangled the dataset into a
            format we could use with the graph. Then, Curtis incorporated our dataset into the code to create our
            interactive graph. Khang and Malvina worked together to incorporate the x-axis title for &quot;Counties&quot; and fixed a
            bug we had in the dropdown menu from svg. Khang and Malvina also put together the index.html file by including the
            graph (sizing, scaling, css) and the write-up.

        <h2>2nd Interactive Design</h2>
        <p>As were are considering moving outside of California we thought it would be helpful if we could narrow down
        the search based on the highest income earning areas across the country. This visualization shows a few things to help
        narrow that search. First off we have a color coded map of the United States which shows the states that have a higher or
        lower average income for the entire state. The only problem with this is that there are only 9 states with an average income greater than California.
        To help expand the search we decided to display the top three average income counties per state which you can see by hovering over the
        red dots on the map. On mouseover the tooltip will display the county name, state, and average income for the county. The
        circles are also to scale, so the bigger the circle, the higher the average income.</p>
